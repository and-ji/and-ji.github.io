    <h1>Driving Conversion And Elegance At Scale On Forbes’ Article Page Product</h1>
    
    <p class="label"><b>Role:</b> Design Director<br>
    <b>Team:</b> Myself, Lead Experience Designer, 2 Designers, Product Owner, Engineering Manager, Lead Developer, 3 Engineers<br>
    <b>Tech:</b> Figma, React, TypeScript, Storybook, Sass/CSS, React Testing Library<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>As a leader of a large, cross-functional team, I drove the creation, testing, and implementation of reusable components for Forbes’ standard article page, where 150M+ monthly visitors consume content on the platform.</p>
    <p>Mentoring designers to consider system priorities alongside craft, I increased their confidence in contributing to the design system, expanded its capabilities, and reduced review cycles by 30%.</p>
    <p>Together we produced an elegant, performant article page that supported a 40% lift to conversion and increased user engagement with high-intent actions.</p>
    
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Forbes publishes content on half a dozen different article templates. In 2023, we decided to redesign this product, centralizing and standardizing its design, while migrating its tech to our React component library, which is powered by our design system.</p>
    <p>We also made numerous improvements to the user experience, resolving headwinds caused by inconsistency, and promoting conversion-focused features.</p>
    
    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>This project had a large team behind it. I was one of two design leads, and managed component authoring and integration. I partnered with the other design lead to improve the UX of the page itself, and two other designers contributed in production roles. There was also a product owner, an engineering manager, a lead developer, and a pod of 3 engineers who worked on third-party integrations, ads, and components. </p>
    <p>My strategic contributions built on my previous work migrating other critical site templates to our design system and React component library. I also partnered with product and engineering leads to scope the project based on a combination of user and business needs.</p>
    <p>In the day-to-day, I reviewed design work and drove cross-functional alignment between design artifacts and components in the codebase. I also created documentation to level-set the logic and UI expectations for each component, and made design decisions informed by A/B testing data.</p>
    
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>Web Vitals data informed a lot of the problems that the team sought out to solve, and the migration process itself drew heavily on learnings from previous migrations, which I had led on the design side. Due to the importance of the product to the company’s business, and the number of stakeholders—editorial, engineering, product, design, revenue—the team conducted 5-6 sprints worth of discovery to clarify the project’s goals. </p>
    <p>Tactically, we saved some time by aligning on what components could be deployed as-is, and which needed additional refinement to meet project goals. CI/CD pipelines with bucketing allowed us to A/B test solutions dynamically.</p>
    
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Legacy article templates were siloed. Each of the half-dozen page types had been considered on their own at creation, which lead to inconsistent user experience. There were often business reasons for this, and a lot of the UX heavy lifting involved recognizing and ameliorating various business cases, predominantly around ad placement and the promotion of paid program content.</p>
    <p>Third-party integrations on the page added complexity. For example, updating the commenting experience took extra work because we had to submit changes via a form and work asynchronously with an external dev team. Although closer collaboration would have been ideal, the level of detail required of this method allowed us to produce meticulous documentation. </p>
    <p>About 70% of the way through the migration, the company decided to replace a vendor for the product, which required the team to pivot to a homegrown solution, then pivot again to excluding the feature entirely.</p>
