    <h1>Increasing Efficiency With Design Tokens</h1>
    <p>Role: Design Director</p>
    <p>Duration: 2-3 months, then ongoing</p>
    <p>Team: Myself, 1 Engineering Lead</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>When Figma launched typography variables in 2023, I saw an opportunity to streamline our design and development processes by integrating tokenized UI colors and typography into our design libraries. This change simplified our workflows and also enhanced the adaptability and reusability of our design system and codebase.</p>
    <p>In this project, I brought together systems design and front-end engineering to create a solution that saved designers time, reduced errors, and improved overall code efficiency. My approach cut dead code by 25% and established a common language that empowered design and development teams to iterate faster and achieve quicker time to market.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Although we had a solid design system synced with a component library in our codebase, inconsistencies in namespacing led to confusion and visual defects. The lack of a single point of reference for color and type meant that both design and engineering teams duplicated effort, spending extra time on fixes.</p>
    <p>Our design library also contained separate sets of type styles for desktop and mobile devices, which complicated maintenance and slowed down updates to designs. Similarly, while there were separate UI colors for light and dark modes, they weren’t organized into standardized themes, which led to visual drift and bug fixes.</p>
    <p>By tokenizing colors and typography, I created shared elements that eliminated redundant styles, unified surfaces and streamlined work for both design and engineering.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Tokens work by assigning a semantic layer to a style that references a defined set of values. Those values are called primitives. The semantic layer remains consistent, even if the value that it references changes. This makes updates simpler and more efficient by requiring changes in only one place rather than across many. </p>
    <h4>Creating Primitives and Tokens</h4>
    <p>I defined primitives of all the UI color and text properties using Figma’s variable management panel. Then, I developed tokens for common use cases—surfaces, buttons, text color, text styles—and mapped those tokens to the primitives. </p>
    <h4>Documentation and Collaboration</h4>
    <p>I documented the token scheme in Confluence and reviewed it collaboratively with the performance engineering team, which then produced a demo for developers. Clear documentation and cross-functional teamwork ensured that my token scheme would easily translate to the codebase.</p>
    <h4>Change Management</h4>
    <p>While some team members were initially hesitant, I addressed their concerns through demos and by being readily available for questions via Slack, standups, and one-on-ones. Over time, focusing on the efficiency gains—such as time saved in updates and reduced manual work—helped everyone see the long-term benefits.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>The rollout of primitives and tokens on the design side took about two to three months, with continuous improvements underway for the codebase integration. The efficiency benefits are already evident: </p>
    <h4>Unified Design-Developer Language</h4>
    <p>Tokens establish a cohesive language between design and engineering, as the same namespaces are used commonly in both worlds. This enables more reusable code, and leads to faster iterations.</p>
    <h4>Enhanced Theming</h4>
    <p>By standardizing themes for UI color and responsive typography, tokens reduce visual defects and simplify light and dark mode support.</p>
    <h4>Reusable Code</h4>
    <p>Implementing tokens in the codebase eliminates unnecessary style overrides, reducing dead code by 25%, and resulting in a codebase that is more resuable, more efficient and easier to maintain.</p>
    <h4>Improved Performance</h4>
    <p>Tokens consolidate typography which allows removing unused or unnecessary fonts from the site. This realignment cut type styles by 50%. This reduces bundle size and improves page load speed—especially benefitting users with slower connections. Improved fonts also eliminate cumulative layout shift (CLS) on site, enhancing overall user experience.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By integrating design tokens, we not only improved the visual stability of the website, but also significantly increased the efficiency of our design and development work. This strategic shift created a more resilient, scalable system while granting teams increased bandwidth to improve it.</p>
